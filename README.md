# Twitter Hider Chrome Extension
Twitter Hider is a simple Chrome extension that helps you declutter your Twitter feed by hiding retweets and self-replies. Retweets are tweets that have been reposted by other users, while self-replies are tweets that a user has written in response to their own tweet.
